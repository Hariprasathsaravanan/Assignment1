# Assignment1
You are provided with a dataset from USA Forensic Science Service which has description of 6 types of glass; defined in terms of their oxide content (i.e. Na, Fe, K, etc). Your task is to use K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier to classify the glasses.
Prepare a model for glass classification using KNN

Data Description:

RI : refractive index

Na: Sodium (unit measurement: weight percent in corresponding oxide, as are attributes 4-10)

Mg: Magnesium

AI: Aluminum

Si: Silicon

K:Potassium

Ca: Calcium

Ba: Barium

Fe: Iron

Type: Type of glass: (class attribute)
1 -- building_windows_float_processed
 2 --building_windows_non_float_processed
 3 --vehicle_windows_float_processed
 4 --vehicle_windows_non_float_processed (none in this database)
 5 --containers
 6 --tableware
 7 --headlamps
